# Spotify-Streaming-Trends

With billions of streams and an expansive global reach, Spotify's platform has become
synonymous with discovering new music and enjoying favorite tracks. The context for
the proposed visualizations is to provide insights into the characteristics and popularity
of the most famous songs of 2023 as listed on Spotify. This dataset encompasses
information about track names, artists, release dates, and their presence in playlists and
charts on Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, and Shazam. Additionally, it includes key musical
attributes such as BPM, key, mode, and various metrics related to danceability, valence,
energy, and more. Key questions to address include: What are the trends in music
popularity across different streaming platforms? How do musical characteristics
correlate with streaming success? Are there noticeable patterns in the release dates of hit
tracks? Visualizing the release dates of songs can reveal temporal trends in how the
number of streams for different songs evolves over the years. This analysis will also help
us identify which artists have the highest number of overall streams and the most
streamed songs across different platforms. Analyzing the distribution of artist counts for
popular songs can also provide insights into the prevalence of solo artists versus
collaborations in the music industry. By addressing these questions, we aim to
understand the dynamics of music consumption in 2023 and identify the factors that
contribute to a track's success on various streaming services.
